Flag_picker_react

To run the application go to the folder Flag_picker.
Then run npm install.
Then run npm start.
It should be running in the develpment local server.
I have used the provided JSON, but since the flags weren't present in the JSON only the country intials are displayed. 
I has been write taking in mind the requirements and the question.
